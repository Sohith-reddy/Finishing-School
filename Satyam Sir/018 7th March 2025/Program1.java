// In the grand kingdom of  Numeria , musicians follow a unique pattern while composing their legendary beats. 
// These beats are played using only  two sounds: 1 and 2 . However, what makes their rhythm truly magical is a
// mysterious rule that dictates how the beats are arranged.  

// The sequence begins as follows:  

// 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, ...

// But the pattern behind this rhythm is hidden! Here’s how it works:  

// 1. The  first number  in the sequence tells us  how many times the first beat (1) should appear  →  "1" (one time)   
// 2. The  second number  tells us  how many times the next beat (2) should appear  →  "2 2" (two times)   
// 3. The  third number  tells us  how many times the next beat (1) should appear  →  "1 1" (two times)   
// 4. The  fourth number  tells us  how many times the next beat (2) should appear  →  "2" (one time)   
// 5. The  fifth number  tells us  how many times the next beat (1) should appear  →  "1" (one time)   

// And so on... The  N-th number tells us how many times the next number should be repeated .

// The  King of Numeria  is fascinated by this pattern and has summoned  you , the greatest coder in the land, 
// to generate the first  N beats  of this musical sequence!  


// Example 1   
// Input = 10
// Output = 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1


// Explanation: 
// - The  first number (1)  means "write one `1`" → `1`
// - The  second number (2)  means "write two `2s`" → `1, 2, 2`
// - The  third number (2)  means "write two `1s`" → `1, 2, 2, 1, 1`
// - The  fourth number (1)  means "write one `2`" → `1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2`
// - The  fifth number (1)  means "write one `1`" → `1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1`
// - And so on...

// Example 2   
// Input:   
// -------
// 15
// Output:
// ----------
// 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 1 2 2
